Project Sprint 6: Software Development Tools

Hi data nerds! 

This is my first time uploading a dataset and describing what it is into GitHub! (Pretty exciting!)

This project is an analysis on Earthquakes; when they happened, the alert level (don't worry, you'll see what this means), and locations.

This is a simple EDA that I made, take it as a puppy dipping its paws into a lake for the first time. Not overly impressive but still very commendable for trying something new.
Also if you thought that was an oddly specific analogy, well that just recently happened with my new pup! :)

## Getting started
Here are the steps to run my project locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.
